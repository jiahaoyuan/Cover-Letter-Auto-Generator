# Cover-Letter-Auto-Generator

Due to the large amount to applications of jobs and interns, I decided to write a Cover Letter Auto-Generator. Apache POI is must be imported.

It can carry out two functions:
1. Detect key words in the qualification section of the job description
2. Generate a responsive cover letter to all the qualifications above depending on your pre-entry value

Example:
1. if one of the qualification is that:
"* familiar with Java",

  then the keyword "java" will be detected.

2. You will have to write a description of yourself about "Java" in advance, which could be outputed accordingly.
You may wrote "Very familiar with Java in both Object-Orientated Programmings" and advanced functions.


Example Output:

* familiar with Java
<br>Very familiar with Java in both "Object-Orientated Programmings" and advanced functions.
